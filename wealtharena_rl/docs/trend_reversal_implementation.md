```python
@dataclass
class TrendRewardConfig:
    # Base reward weights
    reversal_reward_weight: float = 2.0
    continuation_reward_weight: float = 1.5
    false_signal_penalty: float = -1.0
    missed_signal_penalty: float = -0.5
    
    # Signal strength thresholds
    min_confidence_threshold: float = 0.6
    high_confidence_threshold: float = 0.8
    
    # Timing rewards/penalties
    early_entry_bonus: float = 0.3
    late_entry_penalty: float = -0.2
    optimal_timing_window: int = 3  # Days

    # Trend following rewards
    trend_following_reward: float = 0.1
    counter_trend_penalty: float = -0.2
    
    # Learning incentives
    exploration_bonus: float = 0.05
    consistency_bonus: float = 0.1
```

### 3. Integration with Trading Environment

The trend reversal system is fully integrated into the `WealthArenaTradingEnv`:

#### Initialization
```python
# Trend reversal reward component
trend_reward_config = TrendRewardConfig()
trend_reward_config.reversal_reward_weight = self.config.get("trend_reversal_weight", 2.0)
trend_reward_config.continuation_reward_weight = self.config.get("trend_continuation_weight", 1.5)
self.trend_reversal_reward = TrendReversalReward(trend_reward_config)
```

#### Reward Calculation
The trend reversal reward is integrated as the 8th component in the reward function:
```python
# 8. Trend reversal component
trend_reversal_reward = self._calculate_trend_reversal_reward(trades, prev_value, current_value)

# Combine all components
total_reward = (profit_reward + risk_reward + cost_reward + 
               stability_reward + sharpe_reward + momentum_reward + 
               diversification_reward + trend_reversal_reward)
```

#### Performance Tracking
```python
def get_trend_reversal_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get trend reversal performance metrics"""
    return self.trend_reversal_reward.get_performance_metrics()

def reset_trend_reversal_tracking(self):
    """Reset trend reversal performance tracking"""
    self.trend_reversal_reward.reset_performance_tracking()
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Trend Reversal Detection

```python
from src.data.trend_reversal_detector import TrendReversalDetector, ReversalConfig

# Create detector with custom configuration
config = ReversalConfig()
config.rsi_period = 14
config.sma_short_period = 10
config.sma_long_period = 30

detector = TrendReversalDetector(config)

# Detect signals in market data
signals_df = detector.detect_reversal_signals(market_data)

# Get high-confidence signals
high_confidence_signals = signals_df[signals_df['confidence_score'] > 0.7]
print(f"High confidence signals: {len(high_confidence_signals)}")
```

### 2. Custom Reward Configuration

```python
from src.environments.trend_reversal_reward import TrendReversalReward, TrendRewardConfig

# Custom configuration for aggressive trend following
config = TrendRewardConfig()
config.reversal_reward_weight = 3.0  # Higher reward for reversals
config.continuation_reward_weight = 2.0  # Higher reward for continuations
config.min_confidence_threshold = 0.5  # Lower threshold for more signals

reward_component = TrendReversalReward(config)
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

```python
# Get performance metrics
metrics = env.get_trend_reversal_metrics()
print(f"Reversal Accuracy: {metrics['reversal_accuracy']:.2%}")
print(f"Continuation Accuracy: {metrics['continuation_accuracy']:.2%}")
print(f"False Signal Rate: {metrics['false_signal_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Average Reward: {metrics['average_reward']:.3f}")

# Reset tracking for new episode
env.reset_trend_reversal_tracking()
```

```python
config = ReversalConfig()
config.min_confidence_threshold = 0.5  # Lower threshold
config.min_reversal_magnitude = 0.01  # Smaller minimum reversal
config.pullback_max_percentage = 0.08  # Larger pullbacks

reward_config = TrendRewardConfig()
reward_config.reversal_reward_weight = 3.0  # Higher reward weight
reward_config.continuation_reward_weight = 2.5  # Higher continuation reward
```

## Best Practices
