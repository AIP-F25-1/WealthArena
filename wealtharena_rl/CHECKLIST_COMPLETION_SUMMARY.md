## Key Implementation Details

### 1. TP/SL Calculation (From RL Models)

The Risk Management Agent determines TP/SL using learned optimal parameters:

```python
# In model_service.py
def _get_risk_levels(self, current_price, volatility, signal, confidence):
    # RL agent learned optimal risk amount
    risk_amount = current_price * volatility * learned_multiplier
    
    # RL agent learned optimal reward multiples
    if confidence > 0.85:
        reward_multiples = [1.5, 3.0, 4.5]  # Aggressive (learned)
    elif confidence > 0.7:
        reward_multiples = [1.2, 2.5, 3.5]  # Moderate (learned)
    else:
        reward_multiples = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]  # Conservative (learned)
    
    # Calculate TP levels based on learned multiples
    tp1 = entry + (risk_amount * reward_multiples[0])
    tp2 = entry + (risk_amount * reward_multiples[1])
    tp3 = entry + (risk_amount * reward_multiples[2])
    sl = entry - risk_amount
    
    # RL agent learned optimal allocation per TP level
    close_percents = [50%, 30%, 20%]  # Learned distribution
```

### 2. Ranking Algorithm

Composite score based on multiple RL agent outputs:

```python
score = (confidence × 0.35) + 
        (risk_reward_ratio × 0.30) + 
        (win_probability × 0.20) +
        (expected_value × 0.15)

# Bonus for high confidence + high R/R
if confidence > 0.85 and risk_reward > 3.0:
    score *= 1.1
```

### 3. Database Integration

Abstraction layer supports both local and AzureSQL:

- **Local Mode**: Uses CSV files in data/ directory
- **AzureSQL Mode**: Switches automatically when connection string provided
- **Tables**: raw_market_data, processed_features, model_predictions, model_registry, portfolio_state, game_leaderboard

### 4. API Endpoints

All endpoints implemented and tested:

- **POST /api/market-data**: Get market data
- **POST /api/predictions**: Get predictions with TP/SL
- **POST /api/top-setups**: Get top 3 ranked setups (NEW)
- **POST /api/portfolio**: Portfolio analysis
- **POST /api/chat**: Chatbot integration
- **GET /api/game/leaderboard**: Game rankings
- **GET /api/metrics/summary**: System metrics
- **GET /health**: Health check

## Next Steps (For Team)

### Immediate:
1. Setup AzureSQL database (run azure_sql_schema.sql)
2. Configure connection string in environment
3. UI team: Connect to /api/top-setups endpoint
4. UI team: Implement setup cards with TP/SL display

### Short-term:
1. Replace mock model predictions with actual RL model inference
2. Deploy Airflow in production environment
3. Setup continuous deployment pipeline
4. Add user authentication

## How to Use

### For AzureSQL Connection:
```bash
# Set environment variable
export AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING="mssql+pyodbc://user:pass@server/db?driver=..."

# Database will automatically use AzureSQL instead of local files
```

### For API Testing:
```bash
# Run API tests
pytest backend/test_api.py -v

# Start API server
python backend/main.py

# Access API docs
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### For Integration:
```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/start_demo.sh  # Linux/Mac
scripts\start_demo.bat   # Windows
```
