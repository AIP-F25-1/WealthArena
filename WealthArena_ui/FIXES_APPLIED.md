# Fixes Applied to Trading Simulator

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Battle Begins Page (vs-ai-start.tsx) - NOT SCROLLABLE
**Problem:** Content was cut off at the bottom, couldn't see all buttons and cards.

**Solution:**
- Added `ScrollView` wrapper around all content
- Split styles: `container` → `container` + `scrollView` + `content`
- Content now properly scrolls when it exceeds screen height

**Changes:**
- Wrapped all content in `<ScrollView>` component
- Updated StyleSheet to separate container, scrollView, and content styles
- Added `showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}` for clean look

### 2. ✅ Trade Actions Modal - HARD TO SEE/INTERACT
**Problem:** Modal was difficult to interact with, backdrop wasn't properly structured.

**Solution:**
- Restructured modal with proper layering:
  - `modalOverlay` - Main flex container
  - `modalBackdrop` - Absolute positioned dark background (Pressable)
  - `modalContainer` - Centered container with proper width
  - `modalContent` - The actual Card with form
- Changed animation from "slide" to "fade" for better UX
- Increased backdrop opacity to 0.75 for better visibility
- Added proper padding to modal content
- Set width to 90% with maxWidth of 400px

**Changes:**
- Split nested Pressables into cleaner structure
- Added `zIndex: 1` to modal container to ensure it's above backdrop
- Improved styling for better centering and visibility

## Files Modified
