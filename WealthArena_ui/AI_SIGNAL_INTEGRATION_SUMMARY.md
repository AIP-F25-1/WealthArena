## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **New Type Definitions** (`types/ai-signal.ts`)
Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for AI signals:

```typescript
interface AITradingSignal {

  asset_type: 'stock' | 'crypto' | 'forex' | 'commodity' | 'etf';
  trading_signal: { signal, confidence, model_version };
  entry_strategy: { price, price_range, timing, reasoning };
  take_profit_levels: TakeProfitLevel[];
  stop_loss: { price, percent_loss, type, trail_amount, reasoning };
  risk_management: { risk_reward_ratio, win_probability, etc. };
  position_sizing: { recommended_percent, shares, kelly_fraction, etc. };
  model_metadata: { model_type, agents_used, backtest_sharpe, etc. };
  indicators_state: { rsi, macd, atr, volume, trend };
}
```

## API Integration Ready

### Current Implementation:
- Uses mock data that matches your exact structure
- Located in:
  - `app/ai-chat.tsx` - MOCK_AI_SIGNALS array
  - `app/trade-setup.tsx` - MOCK_SIGNAL constant
  - `app/trade-signals.tsx` - SAMPLE_AI_SIGNAL constant

### To Connect to Your AI API:
1. Replace mock data with API calls
2. API should return `Top3SignalsResponse` type:
   ```typescript
   {
     signals: AITradingSignal[];  // Array of 3 signals
     timestamp: string;
     market_session: string;
   }
   ```

3. Suggested API integration points:
   ```typescript
   // In ai-chat.tsx, replace mock data fetch:
   if (userQuestion.includes('signal') || userQuestion.includes('top 3')) {
     const response = await fetch('/api/signals/top3');
     const data: Top3SignalsResponse = await response.json();
     // Display data.signals
   }
   ```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. **Asking for AI Signals** (ai-chat.tsx)
   - User asks: "Show me top 3 AI signals"
   - Bot responds with confirmation
   - 3 signal cards appear sequentially (500ms delay between each)
   - Each card shows compact view initially
   - User can expand any card for full details

### 2. **Viewing Signal Details** (AISignalCard)
   - Compact view shows: Entry, SL, TPs, confidence, risk metrics
   - Click "Show More Details" to expand
   - Reveals: Position sizing, indicators, model info, feature importance
   - Click "Trade" to go to trade setup

### 3. **Setting Up Trade** (trade-setup.tsx)
   - Pre-filled with AI recommendations
   - All signal data visible: entry, TPs, SL, risk metrics
   - User can adjust or accept AI suggestions
   - Clear visual hierarchy and information organization

### 4. **Browsing All Signals** (trade-signals.tsx)
   - Toggle between AI and Legacy views
   - AI view shows full signal cards
   - Filter by asset type (stocks, crypto, forex, etc.)
   - Each card actionable (Explain/Trade buttons)

## Visual Design Features

- **Color Coding**:
  - BUY signals: Green/Primary color
  - SELL signals: Red/Danger color
  - HOLD signals: Gray/Secondary color

- **Progress Indicators**:
  - AI confidence bars
  - Probability bars for each TP level
  - Feature importance visualization

- **Status Badges**:
  - Signal type (BUY/SELL/HOLD)
  - Indicator status (bullish/bearish/neutral)
  - Timing (immediate/limit/etc.)
  - Risk level visualization

- **Information Hierarchy**:
